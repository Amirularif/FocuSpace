# Function of the Website

It starts by asking a few questions to the users before deciding the music suitable. The users, can pause, stop, control the sound or switch to Manual Space.

2. **Manual Space** : The Manual Space function in the website allows the users to manually control ambient musics that were provided on the website. The users can play multiple combination of musics at one time, pause, stop and control the volume of the musics or switch to Auto Space instead.

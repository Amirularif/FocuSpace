    "Rome wasn’t built in a day",
    "The journey of a thousand miles begins with one step",
    "Life is what happens when you’re busy making other plans",
    "If life were predictable, it would cease to be life and be without flavor",
    "It's fun to do the impossible",
    "You put your intention and your attention on what it is that you want to shift and change",
    "Never let the fear of striking out keep you from playing the game",
    "You define your own life. Don't let other people write your script",
    "You are never too old to set another goal or to dream a new dream",
    "Learn as if you will live forever, live like you will die tomorrow",
    "Success is not final; failure is not fatal: It is the courage to continue that counts.",
    "If you are working on something that you really care about, you don’t have to be pushed. The vision pulls you"
